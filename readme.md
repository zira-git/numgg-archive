# numgg archive
An archive of number guessing game just in case it gets deleted also includes all versions also to play older versions which you can find in branches. (you need to run them yourself and to do so you could download the files for the version you want and put in a folder and than open it in VSCode than open the folder and download the live preview extension or the second way is fork this repo and go to settings > pages than change the page to the branch of the version you want) (You're currently on v3.2.5)
